# Natural-Language-Processing-for-Text-Classification-with-NLTK-and-Scikit-learn

In the project, Getting Started With Natural Language Processing in Python, we learned the basics of tokenizing, part-of-speech tagging, stemming, chunking, and named entity recognition; furthermore, we dove into machine learning and text classification using a simple support vector classifier and a dataset of positive and negative movie reviews.

### In this tutorial, we will expand on this foundation and explore different ways to improve our text classification results. We will cover and use:

Regular Expressions
Feature Engineering
Multiple scikit-learn Classifiers
Ensemble Methods
