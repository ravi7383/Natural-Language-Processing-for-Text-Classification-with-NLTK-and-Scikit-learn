Natural Language Processing for Text Classification with NLTK and Scikit-learn
Presented by Eduonix!
In the project, Getting Started With Natural Language Processing in Python, we learned the basics of tokenizing, part-of-speech tagging, stemming, chunking, and named entity recognition; furthermore, we dove into machine learning and text classification using a simple support vector classifier and a dataset of positive and negative movie reviews.

In this tutorial, we will expand on this foundation and explore different ways to improve our text classification results. We will cover and use:

Regular Expressions
Feature Engineering
Multiple scikit-learn Classifiers
Ensemble Methods
